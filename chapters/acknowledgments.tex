This book is the product of several rounds of fieldwork in Hewraman between 2016 and 2023. It would not have been possible without the support of many individuals. It is my great pleasure to acknowledge their contributions here. 

I am deeply grateful to my informants and storytellers in Hewraman Tekht for welcoming me into their community and offering me unique access to their language and culture. I owe special thanks to my primary informant, Amir Qasemi, who patiently answered my many questions about his native language and kindly introduced me to some members of the local community. My friends Kamran Zamani and Heyder Fatemi provided valuable assistance with the logistical aspects of the fieldwork. I was warmly received during each visit to Hewraman, and I dedicate this book to its people in recognition of their ongoing effort to preserve their language in a rapidly changing world. 

The idea of writing a grammar of Hewramî emerged during my collaboration with Geoffrey Khan on our joint study, \textit{Language contact in Sanandaj: A study of the impact of Iranian on Neo-Aramaic}. Through that collaboration, I came to appreciate the importance of documenting Hewramî as an endangered language. Geoffrey's support and encouragement have been invaluable over the years. 

I am especially indebted to my friend and colleague Shuan Osman Karim, who went above and beyond in assisting with the technical aspects of the grammar, including typesetting in {\LaTeX} and developing Python scripts to export the text corpus from FLEx into the required {\LaTeX} template for linguistic examples, as well as to extract glossaries from the text corpus.

I am grateful to Martin Haspelmath for accepting this manuscript into the series `Comprehensive Grammar Library', for arranging the review process with multiple reviewers, and for sharing his own constructive comments on several occasions. I am equally grateful to anonymous reviewers whose insightful feedback on earlier versions of the book significantly improved the work. My thanks extend to all the individuals who contributed to proofreading and offered suggestions on the revised version. I thank Sebastian Nordhoff for his consistent assistance and professionalism throughout the publication process.

Finally, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my wife, Slava, for her unflagging support throughout the years.

The research on the book from September 2021 onwards was made possible by funding from the European Research Council (ERC, ALHOME, 101021183), for which I am grateful.

\title{A grammar of Hewramî}
\BackBody{%
This book is a comprehensive grammatical description of the Hewramî variety of Tekht, grounded in current linguistic methods. Hewramî is one of the most morphologically complex West Iranian languages. It is spoken by several thousand people in the high mountainous Hewraman region situated between Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan.
 
This work is primarily based on a corpus of 46 narratives, collected during several trips to the Hewraman region between 2016 and 2023. This corpus was supplemented by elicitation tasks to provide a detailed account of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Hewramî. Additionally, the grammar touches on prosody and information structure. The analysis is grounded in linguistic theory, particularly informed by the functional-typological approach.
